    <h1>Eros Kankam</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\erosk\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\assignment0\IMG_1552[1].JPG" alt="Eros">
<p>This is me as you can see, my names Eros Kankam, I was born in Chiari a small town in Italy but have grown up in the UK on October 7th 2000 I moved to the UK about 3 to 4 months after I was born
        and have lived here ever since and sadly no I don't speak any italian but I do understand some italian.
        I am currently a student situated at the University of Northampton and am currently studying Bsc Computing (Hons). 

        I am an individual who is desperate to let my creativity run wild, with absolute passion and resolve to deliver designs of many forms, concepts and if need be, to breathe life into the 3D world. I am always learning and improving myself to better understand and adapt my own imagination to anything.
        
        I dream to one day create my own entertainment studio where I could produce 3D movies and games with my own direction, it may be a long ways off but I have never doubted in my mind that it is possible,life is always one step at a time.
